# Multiples
# Part I - Write code that prints all the odd numbers from 1 to 1000. Use the for loop and don't use a list to do this exercise.
for x in range (1, 1001, 2):
    print x
# # Part II - Create another program that prints all the multiples of 5 from 5 to 1,000,000.
for x in range (5, 50, 5):
    print x

# # Sum List
# # Create a program that prints the sum of all the values in the list: a = [1, 2, 5, 10, 255, 3]
a = [1, 2, 5, 10, 255, 3]
print sum(a)

# # Average List
# # Create a program that prints the average of the values in the list: a = [1, 2, 5, 10, 255, 3]
a = [1, 2, 5, 10, 255, 3]
print sum(a)/len(a)
